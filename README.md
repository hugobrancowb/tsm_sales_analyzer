# TSM Sales Analyzer
TSM Sales Analyzer will read a *'Accounting_<realm>_sales.csv'* file, exported from the TradeSkill Master desktop app, and create a report with the most sold items from the account.

This Java program based on [wowSales2019](https://github.com/hugobrancowb/wowSales2019) project.
